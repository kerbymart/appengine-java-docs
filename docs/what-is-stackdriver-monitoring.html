For example, Google Compute Engine provides a resource called <span class="control" id="-yvnhzm_27">VM instance</span>, Cloud SQL provides a <span class="control" id="-yvnhzm_28">database instance</span>, Cloud Pub/Sub provides <span class="control" id="-yvnhzm_29">topics</span>, and so forth.</p><p id="-yvnhzm_25">A <span class="control" id="-yvnhzm_30">group</span> is a collection of resources, such as &quot;all VM instances in my project that are running Cassandra.&quot; Stackdriver Monitoring can automatically detect resources that are related and group them together. You can create your own groups based on resource names, tags and other attributes. Groups are not presently available in App Engine-only projects.</p></section><section class="chapter"><h3 id="metrics" data-toc="metrics">Metrics</h3><p id="-yvnhzm_31">A <span class="control" id="-yvnhzm_34">metric</span> is a measured value that can be used to assess a system. Examples of metrics in the Google Cloud Platform include CPU utilization, request processing latency, amount of storage consumed, and so forth. Metrics are typically qualified, or <span class="emphasis" id="-yvnhzm_35">labeled</span>, by particular resources. For example, you can measure the CPU utilization <span class="emphasis" id="-yvnhzm_36">of VM instance A</span>, the request processing latency <span class="emphasis" id="-yvnhzm_37">in web server B</span>, the amount of storage used <span class="emphasis" id="-yvnhzm_38">by project C</span>, and so forth. When a metric is measured over time, it produces a <span class="control" id="-yvnhzm_39">time series</span> of data.</p><p id="-yvnhzm_32">A <span class="control" id="-yvnhzm_40">service metric</span> or <span class="control" id="-yvnhzm_41">platform metric</span> is a metric that is provided for you when you use a particular service or platform. For example, Google App Engine provides a set of platform metrics to its users.</p><p id="-yvnhzm_33">You can define <span class="control" id="-yvnhzm_42">custom metrics</span> to measure any aspect of your system. Custom metrics might include cart checkouts, user logins, or business KPIs. You are responsible for sending your custom metrics data to Stackdriver Monitoring using the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160424225556/https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/custom-metrics" id="-yvnhzm_43" data-external="true" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">custom-metrics API</a>.</p></section><section class="chapter"><h3 id="charts-and-dashboards" data-toc="charts-and-dashboards">Charts and dashboards</h3><p id="-yvnhzm_44">A <span class="control" id="-yvnhzm_46">chart</span> is a named, visual representation of one or more metrics. You can create a chart that displays the time series data for one or more metrics, or you can aggregate several metrics. For example, you can create a chart named &quot;Web tier CPU utilization&quot; that shows the average CPU utilization for a group of VMs.</p><p id="-yvnhzm_45">A <span class="control" id="-yvnhzm_47">dashboard</span> is a collection of charts and other information such as event logs and incident lists. Dashboards are organized in a single page view. You can create a dashboard to show a snapshot of your system's overall health or to show specific information about factors influencing that health. You can add or remove charts from dashboards as needed.</p></section><section class="chapter"><h3 id="uptime-checks-and-events" data-toc="uptime-checks-and-events">Uptime checks and events</h3><p id="-yvnhzm_48"><span class="control" id="-yvnhzm_50">Uptime checks</span> is a service of Stackdriver Monitoring. You configure the service to check your system's health by sending requests to your applications, services, or URLs from various locations around the world. You can use the results of the checks as conditions in your alert policies, so you will be notified if system health is degraded.</p><p id="-yvnhzm_49">An <span class="control" id="-yvnhzm_51">event log</span> is a time-ordered list of system events related to your application and to the platforms and services it uses. Examples of events include downtime of the cloud infrastructure, notifications related to your alert policy, and code deployments. You can also add your own events to the log. Event logs are supported by Stackdriver Monitoring and are different from the logs supported by Stackdriver Logging.</p></section><section class="chapter"><h3 id="alerts-notifications-and-incidents" data-toc="alerts-notifications-and-incidents">Alerts, notifications, and incidents</h3><p id="-yvnhzm_52">An <span class="control" id="-yvnhzm_55">alert policy</span> is a set of rules that determine whether your resources or groups are operating normally. The rules are logical conditions involving metric thresholds and uptime checks. For example, you can create a rule that your web site's average response latency must not exceed five seconds over a period of two minutes.</p><p id="-yvnhzm_53">An <span class="control" id="-yvnhzm_56">alert</span> occurs when an alert policy's conditions are met, causing an <span class="control" id="-yvnhzm_57">incident</span> to appear in the <span class="control" id="-yvnhzm_58">Incidents</span> section of the Stackdriver Monitoring Console. Incidents remain open until the alert policy rules are no longer in violation or until the incident is manually closed.</p><p id="-yvnhzm_54">You can associate <span class="control" id="-yvnhzm_59">notifications</span> with alert policies. For example, alerts can send email or SMS notifications to people or services.</p></section></section><div class="last-modified">10 April 2024</div><div data-feedback-placeholder="true"></div><div class="navigation-links _bottom"><a href="capabilities-java-api-overview.html" class="navigation-links__prev">Capabilities Java API Overview</a><a href="managing-and-configuring-your-app.html" class="navigation-links__next">Managing and Configuring Your App</a></div></article><div id="disqus_thread"></div></div></section></main></div><script src="https://resources.jetbrains.com/writerside/apidoc/6.22.0-b776/app.js"></script></body></html>
