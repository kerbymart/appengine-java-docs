[Google App Engine](https://web.archive.org/web/20160424230201/https://cloud.google.com/appengine/) provides backends that can automatically scale up to handle millions of users and that are entirely managed for you, eliminating the need to purchase, configure, maintain, or administer servers. Millions of applications including [Snapchat, Rovio, and Khan Academy](https://web.archive.org/web/20160424230201/https://cloud.google.com/customers) run on App Engine.

Android Studio makes it easy to [add an App Engine backend module](https://web.archive.org/web/20160424230201/https://cloud.google.com/tools/android-studio/app_engine/add_module) to your Android project. Simply choose the type of App Engine backend you want and Android Studio will add the required code and dependencies to your project for a functioning, runnable backend that you can easily extend with the features you want, such as data storage.

Android Studio also lets you [run and test the backend locally](https://web.archive.org/web/20160424230201/https://cloud.google.com/tools/android-studio/app_engine/run_test_deploy) and debug it along with your Android app that uses the backend. When you're finished developing and are ready to deploy, you can use Android Studio to deploy your backend to so it can be accessed by all users of your app.

Get Started!
------------

Here's how you can bring the full power of App Engine to your Android apps:

1.  [Add an App Engine module](https://web.archive.org/web/20160424230201/https://cloud.google.com/tools/android-studio/app_engine/add_module) into your Android project.
2.  After you have an App Engine module, learn how to [run, test and deploy](https://web.archive.org/web/20160424230201/https://cloud.google.com/tools/android-studio/app_engine/run_test_deploy) your Cloud-enabled Android app.

Requirements
------------

Using Google App Engine modules requires the Java 7 SDK. You can check the SDK version used by your project in Android Studio by navigating to **File > Project Structure**; the Java version currently being used is displayed in the Project SDK menu.
