# Android Client Code Sample

  

Google Cloud Endpoints is a feature enabling developers to easily develop and host APIs on App Engine with OAuth 2.0 support. From this single API source, Endpoints also lets developers generate strongly-typed client libraries for Java (Android) and Objective-C (iOS), along with dynamically-typed libraries for JavaScript.

The recommended way to add a backend to a new or existing Android app is to use Android Studio's [backend templates for endpoints](https://web.archive.org/web/20160425094126/https://cloud.google.com/mobile/endpoints/add_module) feature. In addition to supporting the addition of an Endpoints backend, Android Studio also provides code validation of your backend, lets you debug the backend along with the Android app, and deploys your backend to production App Engine.

You can find the following complete tutorial for using this feature to add a backend to your Android project at GitHub:
