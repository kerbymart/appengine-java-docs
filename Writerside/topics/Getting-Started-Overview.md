# Getting Started Overview

# Getting Started - Java â€” Google Cloud Platform
Google Cloud Endpoints is a feature that enables developers to easily develop and host APIs on App Engine with OAuth 2.0 support. From this single API source, Endpoints also lets developers generate strongly-typed client libraries for Java (Android) and Objective-C (iOS), along with dynamically-typed libraries for JavaScript.

This **Getting Started** section contains the following tutorials:

*   [Backend API](https://web.archive.org/web/20160424225806/https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/java/endpoints/getstarted/backend/), which builds the backend API required for all of the client tutorials.
*   [Web (JavaScript) client](https://web.archive.org/web/20160424225806/https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/java/endpoints/getstarted/clients/js)
*   [Android client](https://web.archive.org/web/20160424225806/https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/java/endpoints/getstarted/clients/android)
