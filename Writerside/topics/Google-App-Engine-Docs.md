# Google App Engine Docs

Google App Engine applications are easy to create, easy to maintain, and easy to scale as your traffic and data storage needs change. With App Engine, there are no servers to maintain. You simply upload your application and it’s ready to go.

App Engine applications automatically scale based on incoming traffic. Load balancing, microservices, authorization, SQL and noSQL databases, memcache, traffic splitting, logging, search, versioning, roll out and roll backs, and security scanning are all supported natively and are highly customizable.

App Engine’s environments, the [standard environment](https://web.archive.org/web/20160424224927/https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/about-the-standard-environment) and the [flexible environment](https://web.archive.org/web/20160424224927/https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/), support a host of programming languages. The latest versions of Python 3.4, Java 8, and Node.js are available in the flexible environment, PHP is available in the standard environment only, and Go is available in both. The two environments give you maximum flexibility in how your application behaves because each environment has certain strengths. Read [The App Engine Environments](https://web.archive.org/web/20160424224927/https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/the-appengine-environments) for more information.
