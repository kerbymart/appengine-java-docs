This tutorial assumes you have completed the [API backend tutorial](https://web.archive.org/web/20160424231011/https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/java/endpoints/getstarted/backend). including all the Setup procedures. These client instructions incrementally add to those backend API instructions.

## Downloading Bootstrap CSS

This client tutorial uses Bootstrap for convenience, since it provides a nice UI with default settings. [Download the latest Bootstrap](https://web.archive.org/web/20160424231011/http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/) and copy the CSS file `bootstrap.css` into the backend API project directory you created in the [API backend tutorial](https://web.archive.org/web/20160424231011/https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/java/endpoints/getstarted/backend): copy the file to the project subdirectory `src/main/webapp/bootstrap/css`. You don't need to make any edits to the copied CSS file.
